        <p>
        <strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">The HyperText Markup Language</a></strong> or <u>HTML</u> is the standard markup 
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by 
        technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (<u>CSS</u>)</strong> and scripting 
        languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
        and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web 
        page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
